# 🌱 Crop Recommendation System

An intelligent **Machine Learning-based Crop Recommendation System** that helps farmers and agricultural enthusiasts choose the **best crop** to cultivate based on **environmental and climatic conditions**.  

🚜 Leveraging the power of **Random Forest Classifier**, this system suggests the most suitable crop by analyzing multiple factors like **temperature, humidity, rainfall, soil pH, Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K)**.
